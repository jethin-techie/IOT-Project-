# IOT-Project-
This project uses two ESP32 boards communicating through ESP-NOW to run a simple solar panel cleaning demo. The controller sends a “CLEAN” command, and the second ESP32 moves a servo arm to perform the cleaning. Powered directly by a solar panel through a buck converter, the system is portable and easy to expand.
